# SQL_Challenge
During data modeling, departments and employee  tables are main  tables, both  dept-manager and dept_emp tables need  composite keys. I created ERD using  the website of QuickDBD.
In PGadmin, I first  created the tables by defining the columns, primary key and foreign keys constraints. Then I loaded six .csv files into the six tables I created.
